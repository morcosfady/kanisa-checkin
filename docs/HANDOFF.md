# Kanisa Check-in Handoff

## Phase 0: scaffold, schema, architecture
- Created Next.js (App Router, TS, Tailwind) app in F:\kanisa-checkin (separate from Pharaoh's Bites).
- Added supabase/migrations 0001_schema.sql (tables, pgvector, match/withdraw/purge functions) and 0002_rls.sql (RLS).
- Added docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (folder structure, decisions).
- Tested: scaffold installs; `npm run lint` not yet run. SQL not yet run against a Supabase project.
- Open: shadcn, next-intl, Supabase client, auth, everything in Phase 1.
- Gotchas: embedding dim 1024 must match the face model; kiosk reads nothing directly from the DB.
